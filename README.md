Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game development company looking to grow their current
player base by expanding acess. The Gaming Room is looking to create a web-based game that is a copy of their current Android only game, Draw It or Lose It. This game slowly renders images while teams of players guess what the image is. The Gaming Room’s desire to receive a well developed, secure, and scalable code led to outsourcing of the development to our team. The game itself needs to have multiple teams involved in each game, and multiple players assigned to each team. Another restraint on the design was that each team, player, and game instance must have unique identifiers.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt that throughout the design process I was able to objectively look at each step and choose the method that was best for the Gaming Room. I was able to choose the tools and methods I recommended, but also gave a large amount of information on the other choices, and why I ultimately ended up choosing the one I did. In doing this, I was able to show them the best option and they are able to understand why. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the most beneficial parts of the design process were the domain model, evaluation, and requirements. The requirements and constraints are a fundamental step in the development process. Like with any other problem, if you don't understand the underlying issue, you can’t properly solve it. It’s crucial that you understand what the client needs and wants before you jump into designing a solution as you might misunderstand their goals. This just leads to wasted time and unhappy clients, all because you misunderstood the problem. The constraints are another important step as this outlines what you can and cannot do in the design process. 

The domain model was the most helpful. This layout leads to a much more structured program. Just jumping into writing code can be a large mistake. Without a plan there is a largest chance deleted code. Having a drawn out plan, being able to outline functions and classes beforehand, helps create modular and maintainable code in the end. The Evaluation is there to help choose the right tools to use when writing the code. Laying all the pros and cons out on the table allows us to make the best decision and see all possible drawbacks before we jump into production.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would go into some additional details in the Recommendations tab. I would do a little more explaining whe it comes to both the Operating Systems Architectures and the Operating Platform recommendations. I would add more detail so that even those at the Gaming Room without technical backgrounds would be able to fully understand why I decided to go the route I went. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The constraints and requirements of the program are a crucial part of the design process. These steps make sure that the needs of the cline are understood before development begins. We are working to solve the issue of the client so it’s the most important step in making sure this is accomplished.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I would follow the same operation and steps used in this design template in the future. I felt that it was a great guide in the development process. I think additional follow ups with the client would also be beneficial. After the requirements and constraints are written uo, validate this is what the client needs. After getting a skeleton application assembled, validate that the client is still happy with the application. Frequent checks at important milestones throughout development helps to  ensure development is on the right track. Perhaps the client wants to change or update something, if you wait until the end to show them the current process, you will have to go redo more steps then if they notice half way through and it was implemented earlier. on.
